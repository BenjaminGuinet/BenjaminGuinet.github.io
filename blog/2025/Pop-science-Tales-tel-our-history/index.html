These stories make us dream, have nightmares, laugh or think. But where do they come from? To answer this question, I propose to analyse the history of these stories. We will see that stories are a profound part of ourselves and of the history we all share.</p> <p>Firstly, we will look at the reasons that have led and continue to lead human beings to invent stories. We will discover that every culture has its own stories, and that these stories evolve over the centuries.</p> <p>We will then look at how science, and in particular phylogeny (which we will define, don’t worry!), can be used to establish links between the evolution of species and that of stories.</p> <p>Finally, we will explore the meandering imaginations of our ancestors by analysing 2 stories with singular origins:</p> <p><strong>Little Red Riding Hood</strong> <strong>The Cosmic Hunt in the Berber Sky</strong></p> <p>Now it’s time to embark on this superb journey together!</p> <h2 id="why-do-humans-tell-stories"><strong>Why do humans tell stories?</strong></h2> <p>Humans have been telling stories for a very long time, even before they could put them down on paper. Stories, like languages, are in essence information that has been passed down from one person to another over the millennia. To tell a story is to share an experience, an idea or moral values which, when passed on, shape and colour our understanding of our past and present. But have these stories evolved over the centuries?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Contes-evolution-pangolin-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Contes-evolution-pangolin-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Contes-evolution-pangolin-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/Contes-evolution-pangolin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="have-these-stories-evolved-over-the-centuries"><strong>Have these stories evolved over the centuries?</strong></h3> <p>Versions of a story often reflect specific moral standards and mores close to the social classes that tell them. So it’s not unusual to see adaptations that meet the needs of their audience [1].</p> <p>[FIGURE2]</p> <p>Modern stories, though imprinted in the memories of countless storytellers, have been completely transformed from their original versions. Over time, these stories have been imbued with the various desires, struggles and complaints of their tellers, and provide perfect snapshots of the societies that created or modified them.</p> <p>Let’s take a very famous example. Jean de la Fontaine wrote a fable called ‘The Court of the Lion’, which is a story inspired by another fable called ‘The Reigning King’ written by Phaedra. Jean de la Fontaine modified the story to make it rhyme and, above all, to reflect the reality of Louis XIV’s court.</p> <h3 id="is-storytelling-universal"><strong>Is storytelling universal?</strong></h3> <p>Across the centuries and across borders, we always find stories associated with particular eras or cultures [2]. Stories from the Bible such as Noah’s Ark, Greek myths such as Narcissus or even much more recent legends such as Slenderman, which emerged on the internet in the early 2000s, come to mind. Some stories are also known to have originated in particular cultures. Examples include Peter and the Wolf in Russian culture, Hensel and Gretel in German culture, Little Thumb in French culture and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves in Persian/Arabic culture.</p> <p>The disturbing thing is that when you leaf through all these stories in the famous book by the Grimm brothers [3], you realise that some of them bear disturbing similarities. This is the case with the story of <strong>Little Red Riding Hood</strong>, for example, which can be found (in different versions) in many cultures (bear with us, we’ll be analysing this famous example together a little later)!</p> <h2 id="using-biology-to-solve-folklore-problems"><strong>Using biology to solve folklore problems</strong></h2> <h3 id="a-question-then-arises-in-folkloristics-the-study-of-popular-traditions-and-customs-where-do-these-stories-come-from"><strong>A question then arises in folkloristics (the study of popular traditions and customs): where do these stories come from?</strong></h3> <p>To answer this question, we need to have access to traces of these stories that have survived the centuries. However, most of these stories are passed down through oral tradition. There are few historical traces of these texts (just as there are for the study of fossils). Studying the history of these stories can therefore prove very complicated, even using conventional tools of literary analysis. To overcome these difficulties, a promising scientific approach to folkloristics has emerged. The aim is to apply mathematical tools used by biologists to decipher the evolution of living species [4-6].</p> <h3 id="but-how-does-it-work"><strong>But how does it work?</strong></h3> <p>To better understand how these mathematical tools work, let’s draw an analogy with the evolution of species and the way scientists record their evolutionary history.</p> <p>Evolution, as a theory explaining the diversity of living nature, was developed by biologists such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the middle of the 19th century [7]. In a nutshell (see our article on the subject), the theory of evolution explains how organisms change over time. This transformation takes place as a result of genetic changes. These changes can have an impact on the physical or behavioural characteristics of individuals. If these changes bring them one or more advantages, they will be passed on more easily to their descendants. This theory, and all the contributions that have followed, have enabled us to take a fresh look at the processes of life.</p> <p>Thanks to this principle, it is possible to study the evolution of living beings and determine their family relationships. This is known as ‘phylogeny’.</p> <p>Ouch, that’s off to a good start, already a barbaric name for a scientist! Well, not so much if we look at its etymology. Phylogeny comes from the Greek phylon, meaning tribe or species, and gennan, meaning origin or formation. The result is a word that refers to <strong>the study of the formation of species</strong>. Phylogeny studies the formation and evolution of living organisms, as well as the relationships between these organisms.</p> <p>[FIGURE3]</p> <h3 id="the-link-between-phylogeny-and-fairytales"><strong>The link between phylogeny and fairytales</strong></h3> <p>You may be wondering what the link is between phylogeny and my stories? Well, as the famous anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss [8] pointed out, stories, like organisms, probably evolve through progressive changes in hereditary traits! Just like species, the original forms of stories mutate, evolve and spread as they spread. They adapt to different environments and accumulate modifications that are passed down through the generations. They can thus give rise to locally distinct tales.</p> <p>To examine how stories vary between cultures and periods, it is possible to define a series of characteristics, called myths, and compare them between story variants.</p> <p>These characteristics might include the gender of the hero (girl or boy), the species of animal that embodies the villain (wolf, tiger or ogre) or the location of the story (forest, town, mountain).</p> <p>[FIGURE4]</p> <p>The idea is to analyse these characteristics as if they were physical characteristics or genes and to use them to reconstruct the genealogy of the story, just as we would for a species phylogeny. So, if two histories have similar characteristics, it is likely that they have a recent common origin.</p> <h2 id="little-red-riding-hood"><strong>Little Red Riding Hood</strong></h2> <p>Little Red Riding Hood is one of the world’s most popular tales. This tale delicately explores our greatest fears. It’s a story about the struggle between good and evil, about greed and hope, about responsibility and second chances.</p> <h3 id="the-classic-tale"><strong>The classic tale</strong></h3> <p>[FIGURE4]</p> <p>If this story rings a bell, it’s because you’ve inherited the first French version of Little Red Riding Hood. It was written by Charles Perrault in the late 17th century [9,10], and later collected by the Grimm brothers [3].</p> <p>If you’re frowning and thinking that this isn’t the version you know, well, that’s only to be expected, as there are many other versions around the world! In some versions, there is no hunter and the little girl manages to escape on the pretext of a pressing desire; in others, the heroine’s characteristic red colour doesn’t even appear.</p> <h3 id="strangely-similar-tales"><strong>Strangely similar tales</strong></h3> <p>[FIGURE5]</p> <p>Strange similarities with Little Red Riding Hood, don’t you think?</p> <p>What’s even more disturbing is that there are many other stories around the world that bear a striking resemblance to these 2 tales, in Africa and East Asia for example [10-11].</p> <p>This raises an interesting question: don’t all these tales have the same origin?</p> <p>And what if I were to tell you that to answer this question we can use the contributions of biology seen above? Surprising, isn’t it? Little Red Riding Hood: an old story</p> <p>Long before the scientific study that follows, anthropologists were already interested in the tales of Little Red Riding Hood and The Wolf and the 7 kids because of their strange similarities. They did not know whether the two tales had common or distinct origins.</p> <p>[FIGURE6]</p> <p>To unravel these questions, one researcher carried out a phylogenetic study. He had to look at all the stories associated with Little Red Riding Hood: 58 versions and no fewer than 72 plot variants [12]! And to answer the question of their origin, there’s only one solution: read them all! As you can probably imagine, it’s very complicated to collect all this data. This often leads (as in this case) to choices that are more or less debatable [13]. Nonetheless, this study has opened up the field to other explorers of folklore, enabling them to carry out more rigorous work in the future.</p> <h3 id="geographical-origins"><strong>Geographical origins</strong></h3> <p>Finally, the results show that ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ and ‘The Wolf and the 7 kids’ originated in Europe. Traces of Little Red Riding Hood can be found as far back as the Middle Ages [14]. Nevertheless, there are enough differences between them to be considered as 2 tales with very different origins.</p> <p>The variants found in Africa are more likely to be modified versions of ‘The Wolf and the 7 Kids’. The hypothesis is that this tale was introduced to African populations through trade or colonialism. It was then modified to create a new version that spread to societies in the centre and south of the continent, even reaching as far as the Caribbean islands. As for the tales told in Asia entitled ‘The Tiger and the Grandmother’, although it would appear to be a “hybrid” tale that evolved by mixing elements of ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ and ‘The Wolf and the 7 Kids’, the mystery remains.</p> <p>Interesting, isn’t it?</p> <p>To convince you (just a little more) of the value of studying the origins of fairy tales using phylogenetic analysis, here’s a second example that’s just as fascinating.</p> <h2 id="cosmic-hunting-in-the-berber-sky"><strong>Cosmic hunting in the Berber sky</strong></h2> <h3 id="15000-years-ago"><strong>15,000 years ago…</strong></h3> <p>Let’s continue with a much older story.</p> <p>[FIGURE7]</p> <p>In the Palaeolithic period, when our ancestors were still hunter-gatherers, none of this existed. The cap was not invented until the early 19th century, the crown in Antiquity, and what we might think of as a saucepan is not much older. Humans of that era had a completely different way of looking at life, much more in touch with nature. But how do we know what they were imagining?</p> <p>What if I told you that once again, thanks to phylogenetic methods, it was possible to try and infer the imaginations of our ancestors? You might be sceptical, and you would be right, but the approach is nonetheless worthy of our attention. The myth</p> <p>It all starts with a story that is widespread among the peoples of Africa, Europe, Asia and America [15]: the Cosmic Hunt. Although the animals and constellations may differ, all versions of the Cosmic Hunt share a common thread. A man chases or kills one or more animals, and the creatures are transformed into constellations.</p> <p>[FIGURE8]</p> <p>Other versions are found all over the world, such as that of the Iroquois peoples of North America. In this one, three hunters pursue a bear, the blood of the wounded animal staining the leaves of the autumn forest. The bear climbs a mountain and leaps into the sky. The hunters and the bear become the constellation of the Big Dipper. For the Chukchi, a Siberian people, the constellation Orion is a hunter chasing a reindeer, Cassiopeia.</p> <p>How can we explain these strange similarities that can be found in different places? One possibility is to consider a convergence hypothesis (i.e. an appearance independent of history in distant regions). Many cultures around the world would have produced similar myths because of a sort of unified subconscious? As if a collective psyche had driven us to explain the world using the same symbols. But this does not seem to be the most likely hypothesis, given the work of a French researcher.</p> <p>[FIGURE9]</p> <h2 id="the-phylogenetic-study"><strong>The phylogenetic study</strong></h2> <p>In this study, 47 versions of the story and 93 variants were studied [15]! The researcher noted that these versions are very rarely found in Australia. And practically never found in Indonesia or New Guinea. On the other hand, numerous versions are found on both sides of the Bering Strait (the arm of the sea that separates Eastern Siberia from Alaska). This strait was above sea level around 20,000 years ago [16,17]. These various elements, combined with phylogenetic reconstructions, would therefore seem to suggest that this story has a very ancient origin that goes back to the common roots of the Berbers and the European hunter-gatherers.</p> <p>Human migration data also seems to corroborate this reconstruction of the myth. Our ancestors migrating to the Americas from the Eurasian continent would have taken this story with them (on several occasions) before the Bering Strait was buried under the waters of the Pacific. The presence of this story in Africa also seems to support an already known hypothesis according to which humans returned to the African continent from Eurasia.</p> <p>This researcher has even attempted to reconstruct the original story straight from the imagination of humans who lived more than 15,000 years ago. Here it is: “A large herbivore, probably an elk, was chased by a hunter. To escape, the elk galloped up into the sky, where it was transformed by a burst of light into a cluster of stars to form the constellation we now call the Big Dipper”. Of course, this is only an approximation. Nevertheless, it is an interesting attempt at reconstruction that has the merit of nourishing our imagination.</p> <h2 id="conclusion-between-tales-and-stories"><strong>Conclusion, between tales and stories</strong></h2> <p>It is quite remarkable that these stories have survived without being written down. They were told long before our modern languages existed, in dialects that have now disappeared. And yet these stories have endured thanks to the power of storytelling since time immemorial. The motifs in the tales are timeless and universal, involving dichotomies such as good and evil, love and hate, moral and immoral… In the end, although they are often regarded as fictional, and even as a form of narrative for children, folk tales nourish and will continue to nourish our collective imagination.</p> <h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final word</strong></h2> <p>Throughout the ages, the ways in which stories are told have changed. At the dawn of humanity, our ancestors probably told their stories from a natural fantasy around a fire. Today, this can be done at the click of a mouse. We are lucky enough to have access to all these stories! So we should make the most of them. But we should also continue to share them and draw inspiration from them to invent new stories, because if there’s one thing humanity can be proud of, it’s its overflowing imagination.</p> <p><strong>Author:</strong> Benjamin Guinet <strong>Illustrations:</strong> Vincent Lhuillier</p> <h2 id="references"><strong>References</strong></h2> <ol> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Encyclopedia.com., 2020.
