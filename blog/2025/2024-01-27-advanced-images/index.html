So extravagant, in fact, that you might well wonder whether it doesn’t go against natural selection. Take, for example, a peacock’s bulky tail, a fighter’s huge sails or a deer’s impressive antlers. They’re beautiful ornaments, yes, but they’re also very awkward to move around on and highly visible to predators! The question then arises: how can such features be selected when they seem to have a negative impact on the survival of the individuals that wear them?</p> <p>The answer lies in a concept that I’m about to introduce to you: sexual selection. In the rest of this article, we’ll look at why, in the vast majority of species, females choose males and how they choose them.</p> <p>We will then look at other non-human animals to understand some of the strategies that have been selected over the course of evolution to persuade females to mate. We’ll see that there are cheats in the animal world and that sometimes strength and beauty are no match for some clever little buggers!</p> <h2 id="sexual-selection-a-story-about-sex">Sexual selection, a story about sex</h2> <p>What we remember from the concept of natural selection developed by Darwin and Wallace (more details in our article on this subject) is that individuals with the most adaptive characteristics survive better, reproduce better and are therefore selected from generation to generation. However, if you’re an observer of nature, you should be able to spot an inconsistency in all these stories… In fact, if you look closely at the animal world, you’ll see that males and females sometimes have different phenotypes. Males are often more colourful or have flashy ornaments. Females generally have more discreet attributes. In terms of the theory of natural selection, it seems counter-intuitive that individuals should be selected when they are sporting multicoloured coats that make them more visible to predators and make them look very cluttered.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </body></html>
