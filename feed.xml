So extravagant, in fact, that you might well wonder whether it doesn’t go against natural selection. Take, for example, a peacock’s bulky tail, the enormous fins of a fighting fish or a deer’s impressive antlers. They’re beautiful ornaments, yes, but they’re also very awkward to move around on and highly visible to predators! The question then arises: how can such features be selected when they seem to have a negative impact on the survival of the individuals that wear them?</p> <p>The answer lies in a concept that I’m about to introduce to you: sexual selection. In the rest of this article, we’ll look at why, in the vast majority of species, females choose males and how they choose them.</p> <p>We will then look at other non-human animals to understand some of the strategies that have been selected over the course of evolution to persuade females to mate. We’ll see that there are cheats in the animal world and that sometimes strength and beauty are no match for some clever little buggers!</p> <h2 id="sexual-selection-a-story-about-sex"><strong>Sexual selection, a story about sex</strong></h2> <p>What we remember from the concept of natural selection developed by Darwin and Wallace (more details in our article on this subject) is that individuals with the most adaptive characteristics survive better, reproduce better and are therefore selected from generation to generation. However, if you’re an observer of nature, you should be able to spot an inconsistency in all these stories… In fact, if you look closely at the animal world, you’ll see that males and females sometimes have different phenotypes. Males are often more colourful or have flashy ornaments. Females generally have more discreet attributes. In terms of the theory of natural selection, it seems counter-intuitive that individuals should be selected when they are sporting multicoloured coats that make them more visible to predators and make them look very cluttered.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/2_BAS_ornements.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>But were Darwin and Wallace wrong? What’s the point of favouring such disabling characteristics that increase the probability of dying? Well, the answer can be summed up in one simple phrase: to gain access to reproduction!</p> <p>Both knew that natural selection could not be expected to favour the evolution of disadvantageous traits. Although they had differing ideas on the subject, they were nevertheless able to offer a solution to this problem: sexual selection. In his book ‘The descent of man and selection in relation to sex’[1] published in 1874, Darwin proposed a new evolutionary process different from natural selection. This process does not depend on a struggle for existence in relation to other organisms or environmental conditions, but on a struggle between individuals of one sex for possession of the other sex.</p> <h3 id="definition-of-sexual-selection-">Definition of sexual selection :</h3> <p><em>Sexual selection is a theory according to which the evolution of certain remarkable physical traits such as pronounced colouring, increased size or striking ornamentation in animals can make it easier for those who possess them to obtain mates.</em></p> <h2 id="an-explanation-for-the-war-of-the-sexes-anisogamy"><strong>An explanation for the war of the sexes: anisogamy</strong></h2> <p>But why is it that, in the majority of cases, it’s the males who end up with the extra ornaments!</p> <p>The most widespread theory to explain this phenomenon is anisogamy. ‘Anisos’ means non-equal and ‘gamos’ means marriage. Anisogamy therefore refers to a form of fertilisation in which the gametes of the two sexes differ, particularly in size.</p> <p>The male gametes (spermatozoa) are much smaller than the female gametes (oocytes). In humans, an oocyte measures around 120µm whereas a spermatozoon measures around 50µm. In addition, there is a significant difference in production cost between a male gamete and a female gamete. Oocytes live longer and contain nutritional resources, but are more ‘expensive’ (metabolically) to produce.</p> <p>The main idea behind this theory is that males produce more and cheaper gametes. Females have only a limited and precious supply. This imbalance will lead to sexual conflict. Females have an interest in carefully choosing a male, while males have an interest in fertilising as many females as possible.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/3_anisogamie-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/3_anisogamie-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/3_anisogamie-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/3_anisogamie.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Over the course of evolution, this war of the sexes has put males in competition with each other for access to a limited quantity of female gametes, and thus to the much-hoped-for paternity.</p> <p><strong>NB</strong> : it is interesting to ask how anisogamy emerged. But also why there are differentiated sexes. One of the answers lies in the fact that it prevents self-fertilisation. If you’re interested, read <a href="https://sfecologie.org/regard/r78-fev-2018-giraud-billiard-evolution-anisogamie/">this article</a> on the subject.</p> <h2 id="the-cornelian-choice-of-females-between-direct-and-indirect-benefits"><strong>The Cornelian choice of females, between direct and indirect benefits</strong></h2> <p>The males’ objectives are clear. They need females to ensure that they have offspring, and they are competing to get them. What do the females gain and why choose one criterion over another?</p> <p>In some cases it’s quite clear. If we take the example of a female gorilla given the choice between a pudgy gorilla with low social status or a dominant, muscular gorilla, it’s easy to see why she would choose the dominant gorilla. The male probably has access to more food and can protect his territory. The female gains physical security and food. Now, if we take the example of the peacock, it’s a little less intuitive to understand why females prefer the males who do the best cartwheels.</p> <p>The choice of females is based on two main categories of criteria: <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>indirect</strong> advantages.</p> <h2 id="sexual-selection---direct-advantages"><strong>Sexual selection - Direct advantages</strong></h2> <p>A direct advantage will be immediately identifiable by the female and will instantly increase her fertility or lifespan. For example, females can obtain: better access to food, protection from harassing males or help in raising their offspring, or avoid being infected by parasites (or other diseases) by choosing healthy males.</p> <p>Direct benefits can be of various kinds. Some species offer nuptial gifts, which are usually food. This behaviour is found in a wide variety of organisms such as birds, insects and spiders. Sometimes there is a positive correlation between the size of the gift and the copulation time allowed by the female. For example, if the male provides the female with a large prey item, he will be able to transfer more spermatozoa [3,4]. In other species, such as the Red-backed Black Widow, males offer themselves as a <strong>nuptial gift</strong> by allowing themselves to be eaten [5].</p> <p>Another direct and seemingly obvious advantage is choosing a sexual partner who will help raise the young for some species. Females will choose a good father to help them build a nest and feed the young. These behaviours are observed in many bird species, but also in mice.</p> <p>A final example can be found in bullfrogs. Females will prefer males with the ‘best’ territory. The eggs will thus be protected from predators during their development. Sexual selection - Indirect advantages</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/4_BAS_avantages-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/4_BAS_avantages-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/4_BAS_avantages-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/4_BAS_avantages.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="sexual-selection---indirect-advantages"><strong>Sexual selection - Indirect advantages</strong></h2> <p>An indirect advantage is less obvious to the female and can be interpreted as a gamble. The female will have to detect whether a male is a good partner on the basis of clues that are more or less clear (to our human eyes). If she wins her bet, the female will produce healthy offspring who will in turn be able to produce numerous offspring, indirectly increasing the female’s reproductive success.</p> <p>To make her choice, the female will rely on specific signals that will be interpreted as quality indicators. These are often exaggerated physical traits that have been selected in males over the course of evolution. These are called secondary sexual characteristics. There are two complementary theories to explain the appearance of these strange characteristics.</p> <h3 id="when-males-get-carried-away">When males get carried away…</h3> <p><strong>Fisher’s ‘runaway’ theory</strong> proposes that, over the generations, a non-adaptive trait that is visible and guarantees good quality will be selected by the females. A positive feedback loop then follows. Females are increasingly interested in this characteristic, so sexual selection will encourage it to increase.</p> <p>For example, females will choose the males with the longest plumage because their offspring will also inherit long plumage and will in turn be chosen by the females of the next generation, maximising the probability of gene dispersal (Fisher 1930).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/5_BAS_fisher-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/5_BAS_fisher-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/5_BAS_fisher-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/5_BAS_fisher.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This mechanism will then lead to unbridled selection for the exaggeration of ornament and preference. This mechanism will continue until the production costs of the ornament exceed the reproductive benefit of possessing it. In theory it could be any non-adaptive trait as long as females can easily compare them. The cost only appears at the final stage of an evolutionary spiral.</p> <h3 id="the-theory-of-handicap-and-good-genes">The theory of handicap and good genes</h3> <p>The alternative theory to Fisherian runaway evolution is called the handicap theory. It is also known as the good genes theory.</p> <p>According to this <strong>handicap theory</strong>, males with extravagant traits that are even dangerous for their survival would be males of good overall quality. Indeed, males disabled by an extravagant trait were able to survive in a hostile environment even though (for example) they had to drag around a huge multicoloured tail (Zahavi 1975). Their extravagant character would therefore be an honest signal about their physical condition and therefore their “good genes”.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/6_BAS_handicap-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/6_BAS_handicap-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/6_BAS_handicap-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/6_BAS_handicap.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>All these mechanisms are based on the supposed existence of genes conferring greater vigour (“good genes” hypothesis), revealed by external handicaps and therefore only able to be developed by individuals of very high individual quality. However, evidence that females select for good genes remains scarce despite decades of studies on mate choice in many organisms. This apparent lack of consensus continues to create debate about the importance of the good gene model in the field of evolutionary biology.</p> <h2 id="what-strategies-do-males-use"><strong>What strategies do males use?</strong></h2> <h3 id="pre-copulatory-behaviour">Pre-copulatory behaviour</h3> <p>Most of the time, when we think of sexual selection, we think of confrontations as the mating season approaches or sumptuous courtship displays. In the animal kingdom, these strategies are widespread and occur before copulation. If these behaviours have been selected over the course of evolution, it’s mainly because they allow the best males to be chosen. Both in terms of <strong>indirect advantage</strong> (if I choose the male who wins, then my offspring will probably also inherit the genes that will enable them to win the competition in turn), or <strong>direct advantage</strong> (if I choose the strongest male, then I increase my probability of survival and that of my offspring because I will be better protected from predators).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/7_BAS_strategies-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/7_BAS_strategies-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/7_BAS_strategies-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/7_BAS_strategies.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="sperm-competition-sexual-selection-in-detail"><strong>Sperm competition, sexual selection in detail</strong></h2> <p>Females sometimes choose not to put all their eggs in one basket. In these species, they often mate with different males to maximise their chances of having healthy offspring. In this situation, the competition between males takes place at sperm level and is called sperm competition.</p> <p>Males have no interest in other males impregnating the female with whom they have just mated. Thus, in the course of evolution, multiple strategies have emerged at different times during the copulatory stage.</p> <h3 id="before-copulation-the-hunter-loses-his-place">Before copulation, the hunter loses his place</h3> <p>In some species (such as dragonflies), when the female has already been fertilised, the next male may take several hours to clean the female’s spermatic cavity before introducing his seed. In this way, using small feather dusters, he eliminates the sperm of any predecessors and increases his own chances of paternity.</p> <h3 id="during-copulation">During copulation</h3> <p>In order to prolong the copulation period, some males will not let go of the female an inch. The aim is to maximise the chances of their sperm being fertilised during mating. To achieve this, some males act as copulatory plugs. In some phasms, genital contact can last up to 79 days! [10].</p> <h3 id="after-copulation">After copulation</h3> <p><strong>Obstruction of the genital tract</strong>: Some species (cockroaches, locusts and other insects) will accompany their sperm with a substance (cement glands) designed to obstruct the female’s genital tract during subsequent mating (e.g. dung flies).</p> <p><strong>Induced contraception</strong>: Another strategy consists of releasing a substance that prevents subsequent mating. In mosquitoes, males produce a substance through their secondary sex gland that inhibits the receptivity of inseminated females. As a result, they refuse most matings with other males [11].</p> <p><strong>Guarding females</strong>: Others will simply keep their eyes on the females and keep away any males likely to want to impregnate the female [3], as in the case of certain monkeys or mallard ducks.</p> <p><strong>Ugly beauty</strong>: Another tactic is to make females unattractive to other males. This phenomenon is particularly well known in moths. Males deposit anti-aphrodisiacs on females during mating [3].</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/8_competition_spermatique-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/8_competition_spermatique-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/8_competition_spermatique-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/8_competition_spermatique.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="the-animal-world-is-full-of-cheats"><strong>The animal world is full of cheats!</strong></h2> <p>So far we’ve seen that secondary sexual characteristics (for example, the peacock’s tail) were honest indicators of the underlying quality of the males. The costs associated with producing and maintaining these extravagant features informed the females about the overall health of the males that wore them. The more physically fit a male is, the more access he has to quality energy resources. And the more he is able to waste them strutting around the forest with a very long tail. Some males have seen this as an opportunity to optimise their energy allocation by reducing certain costs associated with secondary sexual traits without damaging their overall reproductive success. This is where cheating comes in!</p> <h3 id="examples-of-cheaters">Examples of cheaters</h3> <p>Some male spiders fill their nuptial gifts with silk instead of prey to fool females and reproduce for longer [14].</p> <p>As they are unable to compete with the larger males, some will trick the females into fertilisation all the same. In some amphibians, the smaller males will closely follow the larger males and grab the females attracted to them.</p> <p>The males of other fish species will take advantage of fertilisation by throwing sperm into the water to mix theirs with that of other fish. In some beetles, the males will fertilise the females in secret while a larger male stands guard.</p> <p>Finally, many females choose males who will give up all their time to help with feeding or defend the territory. The males thus find themselves torn between staying with the female and impregnating as many females as possible. As a result, it is not uncommon to observe males sneaking off to impregnate other females. A study of birds, the Prothonotary Warbler, showed that nearly 27% of offspring were identified as the result of extra-pair mating [15]!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/9_BAS_tricheries-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/9_BAS_tricheries-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/9_BAS_tricheries-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/9_BAS_tricheries.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="a-final-word"><strong>A final word</strong></h2> <p>Historically, the field of sexual selection is still very young. Indeed, research in this field only began in the 1960s [22]. So it’s not surprising that the concept of sexual selection remains little known, even though the general public is already familiar with natural selection.</p> <p>Science is not neutral. Scientists are caught up in an axiological matrix from which they cannot free themselves, and from which it is undesirable for them to free themselves, as this would deprive science of its human dimension. It is wrong to think that when a scientist puts down his hat and coat and puts on his white coat, he removes the interpretative filter between us and reality.</p> <p>So we need to remain cautious about the observations we make about the world around us. Although we can have very serious studies on the subject, the fact remains that our perception of things is subjective, especially in a world as complex as ours. The idea of a common value is difficult to maintain. So now, more than ever, we need to share the knowledge and viewpoints of a diversity of researchers on a research topic, because that’s how we can minimise our personal interpretations.</p> <h2 id="back-to-the-article"><strong>Back to the article</strong></h2> <p>In this article we have just seen a few examples that I have chosen, but in reality there are as many differences as there are species. I haven’t even mentioned species that don’t reproduce sexually or those in which the sex changes over the course of an individual’s life (but that’s only part of the story)! Personally, I’m still fascinated by all the singularities that surround us, especially as sexuality in general shapes and occupies a key place in evolutionary processes: the passing on of genes!</p> <p><a href="https://www.projetpangolin.com/la-selection-sexuelle/">French version</a></p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <p>1- Darwin, C., 1875.

Instead, I’ll focus on some of the key milestones along the way. 🙂</p> <p>Like all scientific disciplines, evolutionary biology has its own philosophical roots — and its story begins in ancient times.</p> <h3 id="it-all-begins-in-antiquity"><strong>It All Begins in Antiquity</strong></h3> <p>As early as Antiquity, philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle were already pondering the nature and place of living beings in the world. Aristotle even developed an early system of animal classification known as the <em>Scala Naturae</em> — or “Great Chain of Being.”</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG2_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG2_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG2_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG2_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Aristotle’s idea was based on the belief that living beings could be ranked on a hierarchical scale according to their degree of “perfection.” At the top of this Scala Naturae were the angels, with humans placed just beneath them. All other creatures occupied progressively lower rungs of the ladder [1].</p> <p>Later on, Aristotle’s thinking became intertwined with Christian theology. In medieval Europe, it was widely believed that each species had been individually created by a divine being. Furthermore, it was thought that species were fixed — unchanging over time.</p> <p>Over the centuries, however, a growing number of scientists became captivated by the incredible diversity of life. Motivated by curiosity and wonder, they began to describe the natural world in increasing detail.</p> <h3 id="natural-selection-in-the-modern-era"><strong>Natural Selection in the Modern Era</strong></h3> <p>Between 1600 and 1800, the idea that “the path to God lies through the contemplation of His works” became deeply influential. This belief inspired much of the early work in natural history, leading to ambitious efforts to classify the living world. Yet a major challenge persisted: how should life forms be grouped and defined?</p> <p>In the 18th century, the Swedish botanist Carl von Linné (Linnaeus) proposed the concept of the species as the basic unit of classification. He introduced a hierarchical system that grouped organisms based on structural similarities: Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum, and Kingdom [2].</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG3_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG3_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG3_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG3_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Linnaeus classified species as if they were fixed and unchanging — in other words, as if evolution didn’t occur. But occasional hybrids between species (a phenomenon well known to dog breeders, for instance) hinted that the boundaries between species might not be as rigid as once believed.</p> <p>Over time, the discovery of fossilized remains further challenged this static view of the natural world. Fossils introduced the radical notion that species could go extinct [3]. During the Enlightenment, naturalists began to distance themselves from strictly religious interpretations of the natural sciences. A shift in thinking was underway: species might actually change over time!</p> <h3 id="lamarcks-evolutionary-theory"><strong>Lamarck’s Evolutionary Theory</strong></h3> <p>In the early 19th century, French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was the first to propose a full-fledged theory of organic evolution [4]. His goal was to explain what an animal is — how it forms, how it functions, and how it might change. According to Lamarck, living organisms had the ability to respond — we would now say “adapt” — to changes in their environment. These physical changes were driven by an internal “vital force” and could be passed down from one generation to the next through a process later called the inheritance of acquired characteristics.</p> <p>To understand this theory, let’s look at a classic example: the long neck of the giraffe. Lamarck proposed that giraffes originally had necks similar in length to those of other animals [1]. But to reach the leaves high in acacia trees, they had to stretch — and stretch — and stretch. Over the course of their lives, this repeated effort gradually lengthened their necks. These changes were then passed on to their offspring, who continued the trend, eventually resulting in the long-necked giraffes we see today.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG4_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG4_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG4_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG4_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Despite the revolutionary nature of Lamarck’s theory<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the evolutionary mechanisms he proposed — collectively known as transformism — were far from convincing.

But it’s worth noting that, since the 1990s, solid evidence has accumulated in several species — especially plants, nematodes, and insects — showing that epigenetic inheritance can, in some cases, mimic genetic inheritance, albeit in a less stable manner (see [5,6] for a more detailed discussion and [7] for a critical perspective on the analogy).</p> <h3 id="charles-and-russell-evolutions-headliners"><strong>Charles and Russell: Evolution’s Headliners</strong></h3> <p>Although evolutionary ideas had circulated for centuries, it wasn’t until the work of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that biological evolution gained widespread acceptance [8]. In an era still largely shaped by theological thinking, Darwin and Wallace stood out for their rational, evidence-based approach. Unlike their predecessors, they embraced the reality of scientific observations and sought plausible mechanisms to explain how species change over time.</p> <p>The boldness of their work lay in the fact that they offered a coherent, natural explanation for evolution — one that didn’t rely on divine creation or static species. This groundbreaking mechanism was called natural selection. Darwin and Wallace concluded that all living organisms are shaped by purely natural processes — not by a deity crafting unchanging species once and for all.</p> <p>They identified two fundamental challenges faced by all organisms: survival and reproduction [9,10]. To thrive, individuals must not only survive — by feeding efficiently, avoiding predators and pathogens, and enduring environmental stresses — but also reproduce and produce numerous offspring.</p> <h3 id="the-principle-of-a-scientific-theory"><strong>The Principle of a Scientific Theory</strong></h3> <p>At this point, it’s important to clarify that a scientific theory — like the theory of evolution by natural selection — is not just a guess or a hunch. It’s a well-substantiated explanation of a natural phenomenon, much like the theory of gravity. It has been tested, refined, and supported by extensive empirical evidence.</p> <p>Over time, the theory of evolution has itself evolved — enriched by major scientific discoveries, including the field of genetics.</p> <h2 id="so-how-does-natural-selection-work"><strong>So, How Does Natural Selection Work?</strong></h2> <p>To put it simply: chance proposes, nature disposes!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG6_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG6_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG6_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG6_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG7_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG7_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG7_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG7_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>We should understand natural selection as a process without intelligence or intention. It has no goal, no purpose in the grand scheme of things. Simply put: chance deals the cards, and nature plays the hand.</p> <p>Imagine, for a moment, a round table where all living species are playing a game of poker. Each species is dealt a hand of cards, shuffled randomly. These cards represent the diversity found both between species and within them.</p> <p>Just like in any card game, the hands are reshuffled with each round. As the game goes on, natural selection favors the most advantageous cards — those traits that provide a benefit in a given environment — ultimately determining the fate of each player at the table.</p> <p>The players (i.e., the species) don’t get to choose which cards to play to stay in the game. Instead, it’s natural selection, as an evolutionary process, that “selects” the players whose hands give them a better shot at surviving and reproducing.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG8_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG8_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG8_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG8_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="but-where-do-these-differences-between-individuals-come-from"><strong>But Where Do These Differences Between Individuals Come From?</strong></h2> <h3 id="one-word-mutations"><strong>One word: mutations!</strong></h3> <p>Mutations can indeed be caused by radioactive elements or ultraviolet radiation from the sun — but those aren’t the only sources in nature.

To understand what a mutation is, we first need to understand what is mutating — and what that means for the species.

You’ve probably noticed that some of your physical traits resemble those of your mother — and others your father. Yet, you are a unique individual with characteristics that belong only to you!</p> <p>The explanation mainly lies in mutations occurring in the gametes (reproductive cells) of your parents. And, of course, in how you interact with your environment!</p> <p>On average, a child inherits about 175 mutations different from those of their parents [13].

This coloration allowed it to blend in with the light-colored bark of trees such as birches, providing camouflage from potential predators. Dark-colored moths, due to mutations affecting the genes responsible for wing color, stood out against the pale bark and were thus more easily spotted by predators. These mutant individuals had a lower chance of survival and reproduction.</p> <h3 id="during-the-industrial-revolution"><strong>During the Industrial Revolution</strong></h3> <p>As the Industrial Revolution reached its peak, soot pollution in the air increased dramatically. This caused buildings and trees to darken. Consequently, the lighter-colored moths became more visible to predators like birds, making them more vulnerable to predation. This environmental shift reversed the advantage: dark-colored moths now had a higher chance of survival and reproduction. After just a few generations, black-winged moths became the majority in the population.</p> <h2 id="life-is-in-constant-flux"><strong>Life is in Constant Flux</strong></h2> <p>The example of the peppered moth perfectly illustrates the continuous nature of change. However, evolution is neither a simple process marked only by brief periods of rapid change nor a steady, gradual progression. Instead, it is a complex interplay of random (sometimes sudden) changes, a fluctuating environment, and various forms of competition within and between species.</p> <p>These variables ensure that a species is never fixed in time, accumulating variations over generations. Sometimes people talk about “more complex” or “more evolved” species, but these notions have no meaning in evolutionary biology. All living species today have evolved over the same time span within the tree of life.</p> <p>To say that a species is “more or less evolved” would imply that some organisms have stopped evolving altogether. Even so-called “living fossils,” like the coelacanth (a marine animal whose fossil form dates back to the Late Cretaceous), only appear stable externally. Stability in form does not mean absence of change—alterations can happen at molecular or other levels invisible to the eye. Change is intrinsic to all life, at every level, and has been since life began.</p> <h2 id="controversies-around-natural-selection"><strong>Controversies Around Natural Selection</strong></h2> <p>The theory of evolution by natural selection has faced two major controversies:</p> <h3 id="do-humans-descend-from-monkeys"><strong>Do humans descend from monkeys?</strong></h3> <p>As Darwinists, we reject the notion of a hierarchy or “ladder of life.” Yet, doesn’t this idea persist in modern depictions?</p> <p>We’ve all seen the classic image of human evolution: five figures walking in a straight line towards a final goal, <em>Homo sapiens</em> (literally “wise man,” quite the label…).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG15_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG15_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG15_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG15_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>However, evolution is not directional and does not aim toward any predetermined goal. Humans are therefore not, contrary to what that illustration might suggest, perfect creatures. Every species is constantly evolving. There is no way to measure “progress” in evolution. Thus, the old hierarchical pyramid of life, where humans occupied the pinnacle, has given way to a beautiful egalitarian circle [15], in which every species continues to accumulate variations and evolve!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG16_NS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG16_NS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG16_NS-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG16_NS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>To sum up, no species is superior to another. If we all share the planet Earth right now—from tiny 3-gram shrimp to majestic African elephants and delicate orchids—it’s because each of us has managed to survive and reproduce.</p> <h2 id="rejections-of-the-theory"><strong>Rejections of the Theory</strong></h2> <p>Today, the theory of evolution is widely accepted, even by many religious institutions. However, it has often been misused, sometimes twisted to justify actions (including political decisions), or outright denied when convenient for those in power. It’s important to be aware of this. Evolutionary theory is a scientific framework that explains how species change over time on our planet. It helps us understand, for example, why a lion might kill all the cubs in a litter that are not his own. What it does not do is tell us whether such behavior is good or bad. Always be cautious when evolution is invoked in political debates or reform proposals. Sociology exists as a distinct discipline from biology—and for very good reasons.</p> <h2 id="final-words"><strong>Final Words</strong></h2> <p>Our body of knowledge is like a glass of water taken from the vast ocean—both insignificant and immense at the same time. Yet, it’s enough to illuminate our minds, or at least mine! You now understand that no species is immutable, not even humans. Each one of us is unique, and it is these differences that natural selection acts upon throughout the evolutionary process.</p> <p>It’s clear that today, the theory of evolution stands on a broad foundation of evidence from diverse scientific fields. Yet there remains much to discover! We are just beginning to unravel the mechanisms of new evolutionary forces that also have major impacts on the trajectories of species. Among these are migration, random genetic drift, and gene transfer between species. We owe these elegant discoveries to passionate researchers who have succeeded each other over time—and who continue, even now, to unravel one of biology’s greatest mysteries: the evolution of species.</p> <p>Author: Benjamin Guinet (Reviewed by: Laura Touzot and Salomé Bourg)</p> <p><a href="https://www.projetpangolin.com/selection-naturelle-mecanismes-exemples-concrets/">French version</a></p> <p><strong>References</strong></p> <ol> <li>Hodos W.

But have you ever wondered where these stories come from? To answer this question, I invite you on a journey through the history of storytelling. Along the way, we’ll see that stories are not only deeply personal, but also woven into the fabric of our shared human history.</p> <p>We’ll begin by exploring the reasons why humans have always created stories—and why we continue to do so. We’ll discover that storytelling is a universal trait: every culture has its tales, which evolve and adapt through the ages.</p> <p>Next, we’ll examine how science—particularly phylogenetics (don’t worry, we’ll explain what that means!)—can be applied to trace the evolution of stories, much like we trace the lineage of living species.</p> <p>Finally, we’ll dive into the rich imaginations of our ancestors by analyzing two stories with particularly intriguing and unusual origins.</p> <ul> <li><a href="#little-red-riding-hood"><strong>Little Red Riding Hood</strong></a></li> <li><a href="#the-cosmic-hunt-in-the-berber-sky"><strong>The Cosmic Hunt in the Berber Sky</strong></a></li> </ul> <p>Now, let’s embark on this fascinating journey together!</p> <h2 id="why-do-humans-tell-stories"><strong>Why do humans tell stories?</strong></h2> <p>Humans have been telling stories for tens of thousands of years—long before writing existed. Like language, stories are a form of information passed down from generation to generation. Through storytelling, we share experiences, convey ideas, and transmit values that help shape how we understand ourselves, our history, and the world around us. But have these stories remained the same over time, or have they evolved with us through the ages?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG2_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG2_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG2_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG2_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h3 id="have-these-stories-evolved-over-the-centuries"><strong>Have these stories evolved over the centuries?</strong></h3> <p>Versions of a story often reflect specific moral standards and mores close to the social classes that tell them. So it’s not unusual to see adaptations that meet the needs of their audience [1].</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG3_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG3_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG3_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG3_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Modern stories, though imprinted in the memories of countless storytellers, have been completely transformed from their original versions. Over time, these stories have been imbued with the various desires, struggles and complaints of their tellers, and provide perfect snapshots of the societies that created or modified them.</p> <p>Let’s take a very famous example. Jean de la Fontaine wrote a fable called ‘The Court of the Lion’, which is a story inspired by another fable called ‘The Reigning King’ written by Phaedra. Jean de la Fontaine modified the story to make it rhyme and, above all, to reflect the reality of Louis XIV’s court.</p> <h3 id="is-storytelling-universal"><strong>Is storytelling universal?</strong></h3> <p>Across centuries and continents, stories have always been tied to specific times and cultures [2]. Think of biblical tales like Noah’s Ark, Greek myths such as Narcissus, or even more recent legends like Slenderman, which emerged on the internet in the early 2000s. Many stories are closely associated with particular cultural origins—for example, Peter and the Wolf in Russian folklore, Hansel and Gretel in German tradition, Le Petit Poucet (Little Thumb) in French tales, and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from Persian and Arabic lore.</p> <p>What’s particularly intriguing is that when you leaf through the pages of the famous Grimm brothers’ collection [3], you start to notice striking similarities between some of these tales. Take Little Red Riding Hood, for instance—a story that appears in surprisingly similar forms across many different cultures. (Stay with us—we’ll dive deeper into this fascinating example a bit later!)</p> <h2 id="using-biology-to-solve-folklore-problems"><strong>Using biology to solve folklore problems</strong></h2> <p><strong>A question then arises in folkloristics (the study of popular traditions and customs): where do these stories come from?</strong></p> <p>To explore the origins and evolution of stories, we must rely on the traces that have withstood the passage of time. Yet most of these tales have been passed down orally, leaving behind few written records—much like the sparse fossil evidence available to paleontologists. This makes tracing the history of stories particularly challenging, even with the tools of traditional literary analysis.</p> <p>To overcome these limitations, a promising new approach in folkloristics has emerged: the application of mathematical methods borrowed from biology to study the evolution of storytelling [4–6]. Just as biologists reconstruct the evolutionary trees of living species, researchers can now use similar tools to map the branching paths of narrative traditions across cultures and time.</p> <h3 id="but-how-does-it-work"><strong>But how does it work?</strong></h3> <p>To better understand how these mathematical tools work, let’s first draw a parallel with the evolution of species and how scientists reconstruct their history.</p> <p>The theory of evolution—which explains the incredible diversity of life on Earth—was developed in the mid-19th century by biologists such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace [7]. In simple terms (see our article on the topic for more details), evolution describes how organisms change over time through genetic variation. These changes can affect an organism’s physical traits or behavior. If a particular change proves beneficial, it is more likely to be passed down to future generations. This foundational theory—and the scientific advances that followed—transformed how we understand the living world.</p> <p>One powerful tool that emerged from this theory is phylogeny: the study of the evolutionary relationships among organisms.</p> <p>Wait—“phylogeny”? That might sound like an intimidating word, but it’s not so scary once you break it down. It comes from the Greek phylon, meaning “tribe” or “species”, and gennan, meaning “to produce” or “to generate”. So, phylogeny quite literally means <strong>the study of the formation of species</strong>. In practice, it helps scientists trace how living organisms have evolved over time and how they are related to one another.</p> <h3 id="the-link-between-phylogeny-and-fairytales"><strong>The link between phylogeny and fairytales</strong></h3> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG4_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG4_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG4_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG4_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>ou might be wondering—what does phylogeny have to do with stories? As the renowned anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss once observed [8], stories, much like living organisms, likely evolve through the gradual accumulation of inherited traits. Just as species change over time, the earliest versions of stories adapt, mutate, and diversify as they are passed from one generation to the next. As they spread across cultures and environments, these tales evolve—sometimes subtly, sometimes dramatically—giving rise to distinct local variations.</p> <p>To study how stories differ across cultures and historical periods, researchers identify a set of defining features, or “mythemes,” which they can compare across story variants.</p> <p>These features might include the gender of the protagonist (girl or boy), the nature of the antagonist (wolf, tiger, ogre), or the setting of the tale (forest, village, mountain). By analyzing these elements, we can trace how stories transform and branch out—just like species on an evolutionary tree.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG5_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG5_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG5_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG5_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The idea is to analyse these characteristics as if they were physical characteristics or genes and to use them to reconstruct the genealogy of the story, just as we would for a species phylogeny.

This raises a fascinating question: could all these stories share a common origin?</p> <p>Now, what if I told you that to explore this question, we can actually turn to the biological methods we discussed earlier? Surprising, isn’t it?</p> <h3 id="little-red-riding-hood-an-old-story"><strong>Little Red Riding Hood: an old story</strong></h3> <p>Even before scientific studies entered the picture, anthropologists were captivated by the parallels between <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> and <em>The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats</em>. The similarities were so pronounced that researchers long debated whether these stories stemmed from a shared ancestral tale or had developed independently. The question remained open—until new methods offered a fresh perspective.</p> <p>To unravel these questions, one researcher conducted a phylogenetic study of the <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> story. He examined 58 versions of the tale and identified no fewer than 72 distinct plot variants [12]! And to trace their origins, there was only one option: read them all. As you can imagine, collecting such a vast dataset is no small task. It often involves making choices—some more debatable than others [13]. Still, this pioneering study opened the door for future folklorists to take a more rigorous and systematic approach.</p> <h3 id="geographical-origins"><strong>Geographical Origins</strong></h3> <p>The results revealed that both Little Red Riding Hood and The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats originated in Europe. Traces of Little Red Riding Hood can be found as early as the Middle Ages [14]. However, the two stories differ enough in structure and content to be considered separate tales with distinct origins.</p> <p>Variants found in Africa appear to be adapted versions of The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats. Researchers believe this tale was introduced through trade or colonial contact, later evolving into a localized version that spread throughout central and southern Africa—even reaching the Caribbean islands.</p> <p>In contrast, the Asian tale The Tiger and the Grandmother seems to be a fascinating hybrid, blending elements from both Little Red Riding Hood and The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats. Yet its exact origins remain something of a mystery.</p> <p>Fascinating, isn’t it?</p> <p>And if you’re still not convinced of the power of phylogenetic tools to study the evolution of fairy tales, don’t worry—we have one more captivating example coming up.</p> <h2 id="the-cosmic-hunt-in-the-berber-sky"><strong>The Cosmic hunt in the Berber sky</strong></h2> <h3 id="15000-years-ago"><strong>15,000 years ago…</strong></h3> <p>Let’s continue with a much older story.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG10_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG10_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG10_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG10_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In the Palaeolithic era, when our ancestors still lived as hunter-gatherers, the world as we know it today didn’t exist. The cap wasn’t invented until the early 19th century, the crown dates back to Antiquity, and even the object we now call a saucepan is a relatively recent innovation. Humans of that time had a completely different relationship with their environment—one that was far more attuned to nature. But how can we possibly glimpse what they imagined?</p> <p>What if I told you that, once again, phylogenetic methods offer a way to infer the contents of our ancestors’ imaginations? You’d be right to be sceptical—but the approach is genuinely intriguing and deserves a closer look.</p> <h3 id="the-myth"><strong>The Myth</strong></h3> <p>It all begins with a tale found across continents—in Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas [15]: the Cosmic Hunt. While the characters and constellations vary, all versions share a central narrative thread: a man pursues or kills one or more animals, and these animals are ultimately transformed into stars.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG11_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG11_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG11_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG11_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Versions of the Cosmic Hunt can be found all over the world. Take, for example, the tale of the Iroquois peoples of North America. In their story, three hunters chase a bear whose blood stains the autumn leaves as it flees. The bear climbs a mountain and leaps into the sky, transforming along with the hunters into the constellation of the Big Dipper. Meanwhile, among the Chukchi of Siberia, the constellation Orion represents a hunter pursuing a reindeer, while Cassiopeia plays a key role in their celestial stories.</p> <p>How can we explain these striking similarities across such distant cultures? One possible explanation is the convergence hypothesis—that these myths arose independently in separate regions due to similar human experiences or a shared collective subconscious. In other words, different peoples might have crafted similar stories because certain symbols and themes resonate universally when trying to make sense of the world.</p> <p>However, this theory isn’t the most convincing one, especially in light of the research conducted by a researcher who offers a different perspective.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/FIG12_tales-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/FIG12_tales-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/FIG12_tales-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/FIG12_tales.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="the-phylogenetic-study"><strong>The phylogenetic study</strong></h2> <p>In this study, the researcher analyzed 47 versions of the story and identified 93 distinct variants [15]. Interestingly, these versions are rarely found in Australia and virtually absent from Indonesia and New Guinea. In contrast, many versions appear on both sides of the Bering Strait—the stretch of water that once connected Eastern Siberia and Alaska about 20,000 years ago, when it was above sea level [16,17]. Taken together with phylogenetic reconstructions, these findings suggest that the story has a very ancient origin, tracing back to the common ancestors of Berber populations and European hunter-gatherers.</p> <p>Data on human migrations further support this hypothesis. As our ancestors migrated from Eurasia into the Americas—crossing the Bering land bridge before it was submerged under rising seas—they likely carried this story with them. The presence of the tale in Africa also aligns with the well-established theory that humans later migrated back from Eurasia into the African continent.</p> <p>The researcher even attempted to reconstruct the original version of the myth, imagining what our ancestors might have envisioned more than 15,000 years ago. Here is the proposed narrative: “A large herbivore, probably an elk, is chased by a hunter. To escape, the elk gallops up into the sky, where it transforms in a burst of light into a cluster of stars—the constellation we now call the Big Dipper.”</p> <p>Of course, this reconstruction is only an approximation. Still, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the imagination of our distant ancestors and invites us to envision how these ancient stories might have taken shape.</p> <p>This is just one example, but many others can be found in the literature—for instance, the tale of <em>The Smith and the Devil</em>, which was adapted into a Netflix film in the Basque language, can be traced back to the Bronze Age [18].</p> <h2 id="conclusion-between-tales-and-stories"><strong>Conclusion, between tales and stories</strong></h2> <p>It is truly remarkable that these stories have survived for millennia without ever being written down. They were passed along long before our modern languages existed, spoken in dialects now lost to time. Yet, through the enduring power of storytelling, these tales have persevered. Their motifs are timeless and universal—exploring fundamental dichotomies such as good versus evil, love versus hate, and moral versus immoral. Though often dismissed as mere fiction or children’s narratives, folk tales continue to nourish and enrich our collective imagination.</p> <h2 id="final-word"><strong>Final word</strong></h2> <p>Over the centuries, the ways we tell stories have evolved dramatically. In humanity’s earliest days, our ancestors likely gathered around a fire, weaving tales born from their natural surroundings and vivid imaginations. Today, stories are shared instantly with a click. We are privileged to have access to this vast legacy of storytelling—and we should cherish it. But more importantly, we must keep sharing these stories and let them inspire us to create new ones. Because if there is one thing humanity can truly be proud of, it is the boundless power of our imagination.</p> <p><strong>Author:</strong> Benjamin Guinet <strong>Illustrations:</strong> Vincent Lhuillier</p> <p><a href="https://www.projetpangolin.com/les-contes-bercent-notre-enfance-et-retracent-notre-histoire/">French version</a></p> <h2 id="references"><strong>References</strong></h2> <ol> <li> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Encyclopedia.com., 2020.
