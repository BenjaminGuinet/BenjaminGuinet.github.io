  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

            Large dsDNA viruses from the Naldaviricetes class are currently composed of four viral families infecting insects and/or crustaceans. Since the 1970s, particles described as filamentous viruses (FVs) have been observed by electronic microscopy in several species of Hymenoptera parasitoids but until recently, no genomic data was available. This study provides the first comparative morphological and genomic analysis of these FVs. We analyzed the genomes of seven FVs, six of which were newly obtained, to gain a better understanding of their evolutionary history. We show that these FVs share all genomic features of the Naldaviricetes while encoding five specific core genes that distinguish them from their closest relatives, the Hytrosaviruses. By mining public databases, we show that FVs preferentially infect Hymenoptera with parasitoid lifestyle and that these viruses have been repeatedly integrated into the genome of many insects, particularly Hymenoptera parasitoids, overall suggesting a long-standing specialization of these viruses to parasitic wasps. Finally, we propose a taxonomical revision of the class Naldaviricetes in which FVs related to the Leptopilina boulardi FV constitute a fifth family. We propose to name this new family, Filamentoviridae.},

	abstract = {The accidental endogenization of viral elements within eukaryotic genomes can occasionally provide significant evolutionary benefits, giving rise to their long-term retention, that is, to viral domestication. For instance, in some endoparasitoid wasps (whose immature stages develop inside their hosts), the membrane-fusion property of double-stranded DNA viruses have been repeatedly domesticated following ancestral endogenizations. The endogenized genes provide female wasps with a delivery tool to inject virulence factors that are essential to the developmental success of their offspring. Because all known cases of viral domestication involve endoparasitic wasps, we hypothesized that this lifestyle, relying on a close interaction between individuals, may have promoted the endogenization and domestication of viruses. By analyzing the composition of 124 Hymenoptera genomes, spread over the diversity of this clade and including free-living, ecto, and endoparasitoid species, we tested this hypothesis. Our analysis first revealed that double-stranded DNA viruses, in comparison with other viral genomic structures (ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA), are more often endogenized and domesticated (that is, retained by selection) than expected from their estimated abundance in insect viral communities. Second, our analysis indicates that the rate at which dsDNA viruses are endogenized is higher in endoparasitoids than in ectoparasitoids or free-living hymenopterans, which also translates into more frequent events of domestication. Hence, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endoparasitoid lifestyle has facilitated the endogenization of dsDNA viruses, in turn, increasing the opportunities of domestications that now play a central role in the biology of many endoparasitoid lineages.},

	abstract = {Some species of parasitic wasps have domesticated viral machineries to deliver immunosuppressive factors to their hosts. Up to now, all described cases fall into the Ichneumonoidea superfamily, which only represents around 10\% of hymenoptera diversity, raising the question of whether such domestication occurred outside this clade. Furthermore, the biology of the ancestral donor viruses is completely unknown. Since the 1980’s, we know that Drosophila parasitoids belonging to the Leptopilina genus, which diverged from the Ichneumonoidea superfamily 225My ago, do produce immuno-suppressive viruslike structure in their reproductive apparatus. However, the viral origin of these structures has been the subject of debate. In this paper, we provide genomic and experimental evidence that those structures do derive from an ancestral virus endogenization event. Interestingly, its close relatives induce a behaviour manipulation in present-day wasps. Thus, we conclude that virus domestication is more prevalent than previously thought and that behaviour manipulation may have been instrumental in the birth of such associations.},
