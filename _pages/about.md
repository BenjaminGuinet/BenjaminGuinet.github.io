With an MSc in `Evolutionary Biology and Ecology`, a PhD in `Evolutionary Genomics`, and a first postdoctoral experience in `Paleometagenomics`, I specialize in investigating the `interactions` between microbes and their hosts through an interdisciplinary `eco-evolutionary` lens. Over five years of research, I have contributed to a range of projects exploring genomic and evolutionary questions, leading to publications and developing expertise across diverse biological systems—from tiny parasitic wasps to giant woolly mammoths. My work spans multiple scales and time periods, from `current biological interactions` involving symbiotic viruses, to `Late Pleistocene` mammalian remains, and even to `endogenous viral elements` dating back millions of years.
